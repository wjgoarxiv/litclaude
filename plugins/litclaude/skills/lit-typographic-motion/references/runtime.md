# Runtime, pre-warm and BLOCKED states

## What is installed where

| Piece | Where | Installed by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Engine code, GLSL passes, scenes, bundled fonts | this skill directory (the plugin) | the LitClaude package |
| opentype.js 2.0.0 (pinned in `engine/package-lock.json`) | `<cache>/node-<lockdigest>-<platform>-<arch>/` | `litclaude-ai motion-runtime install` (`npm ci --omit=dev --ignore-scripts`) |
| Galmuri9, MesloLGS NF and their licence files | `<cache>/fonts/` (pinned URL, sha256-verified) | same command |
| Pretendard Regular / Bold | `../lit-pptx/fonts/pretendard/` (reused by path, hash-checked) | the package |
| librosa venv (Tier 2, optional) | `<cache>/audio-<digest>/` from `engine/audio/requirements.lock` with `pip install --require-hashes --only-binary=:all:` | `litclaude-ai motion-runtime install --audio` |
| Word-timing models (Tier 3, optional) | not in this release | `--word-timing` prints the size and pins, then stops |
| Chrome, ffmpeg, img2webp | host tools, never bundled | the user |

`<cache>` is `$LITCLAUDE_MOTION_RUNTIME`, otherwise `${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/litclaude/motion-runtime`.

## Pre-warm, never first use

The cache is written only by `litclaude-ai motion-runtime install`; `litclaude-ai install` (and the
global npm postinstall, which runs it) attempts the same pre-warm and prints one receipt line if it
fails, without failing the install. A Claude Code marketplace install runs no lifecycle step, so
there the explicit command is the pre-warm. A render session only reads the cache: it never runs
npm, pip or a download, because a sandboxed session usually has no network or no write access
outside the workspace, and a half-finished install would look like a broken engine.

`litclaude-ai doctor` (and `npm run doctor` in a checkout) prints the five probes: Chrome,
ffmpeg with the preview encoder rung, the WebGL2 renderer from a real headless probe, the software-GL
or unknown-renderer warning, and the pre-warm state naming anything missing and the fix command.
`litclaude-ai motion-runtime status` prints the pre-warm state alone.

## Exit codes

| Exit | Name | Meaning | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | OK | the mode finished; for `make`, the gate passed | — |
| 10 | BLOCKED_NO_CHROME | Chrome is missing or cannot launch headless; the message carries the launcher's first error line | install Chrome or set `CHROME_PATH` |
| 11 | BLOCKED_NO_WEBGL2 | Chrome runs but no flag rung gives a WebGL2 context, not even SwiftShader | GPU drivers; nothing can render without WebGL2 |
| 12 | BLOCKED_NO_FFMPEG_FOR_VIDEO | ffmpeg missing; stills and sheet were still written | install ffmpeg |
| 13 | GATE_FAIL_QA | the gate (or the pre-flight gate) failed; see `gate-report.txt` | fix the named rule; next round |
| 14 | BLOCKED_DEPS_NOT_PREWARMED | engine dependencies (or Tier-3 models) missing from the cache | `litclaude-ai motion-runtime install` outside the session |
| 15 | BLOCKED_FONT_FETCH | a required font is missing or its sha256 differs | same command |

Each state names its real cause. A sandbox that refuses `listen` is not a blocked state: frames are
pulled over CDP from the same readback buffer, and the report names that egress.

## Chrome flags (MO-A-51)

Tried in order, each counting only if a page gets WebGL2: macOS `--use-angle=metal
--enable-gpu-rasterization --ignore-gpu-blocklist`; Linux `--use-angle=gl --enable-gpu-rasterization
--ignore-gpu-blocklist`; Windows `--use-angle=d3d11 --enable-gpu-rasterization`; then the software rung
`--use-angle=swiftshader --enable-unsafe-swiftshader`. Every rung adds the three anti-throttling
flags. The rung that worked is recorded as `chromeFlags`. The Chrome profile lives in the run's own
`.run/chrome/` directory and is removed when the render ends. Every launch also passes
`--use-mock-keychain` and `--password-store=basic`, so Chrome never asks the OS keychain for its
safe-storage item (on macOS a fresh profile would otherwise raise a keychain dialog).

## Audio tiers

- **Tier 1 (default):** text reading time on a 100 BPM grid (or the brief's `bpm`).
- **Tier 2:** an audio file in the brief and a ready venv: librosa beat grid, cuts on detected
  beats, audio muxed into the MP4. A missing venv, a venv whose pins changed, or a failed analysis
  falls back to Tier 1 with the warning "audio analysis not prewarmed: run litclaude-ai
  motion-runtime install --audio" (or the analysis error). It is never repaired in the session.
- **Tier 3:** `--word-timing` only; exits 14 in this release. Never MMS_FA or madmom weights,
  never aubio or essentia, at any tier.
