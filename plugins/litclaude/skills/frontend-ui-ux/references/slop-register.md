# Slop register

This register loads with `references/craft-floor.md` whenever `frontend-ui-ux` activates. A row
earns a `SLOP-*` id when a designer would read it as a reflex default, the "made by a generator"
tell, rather than a plain bug below a number. A genericness tell is at most `MEDIUM`: it never
blocks "done" by itself. The only `HIGH` rows are the three functional ones (SLOP-057 broken
image, SLOP-058 dead text, nav or call-to-action link, SLOP-059 typeless button beside another
submit), which block "done" like a craft-floor HIGH until fixed or stated as a limitation.

How to use it:

- **Run the deterministic rows first.** The interface probe measures every row marked
  *probe*; the static fallback reads the rows marked *static* from source when no browser can
  render. Only then form a holistic view (SLOP-055, SLOP-056), and ground it in the rows that
  fired. "Looks generic" with no cited row is not a finding.
- **Coverage "judgment"** means DET-assist: the probe prints the hit under "Judgment calls", never
  as a finding, and a person decides (a recorded reason for a common font, a real sequence behind
  section numbers, an emoji policy the brief asked for, a real source behind a figure). The
  severity applies only once you confirm it; state the call as Inferred.
- **Copy rows read authored copy only**: visible text of the top document, outside code, form
  values, `<title>` and attributes. Text inside a frame is never charged to the page.
- **Fix with the cheapest tool**: delete, then use the platform, then reuse, then correct a
  value, then add.
- **Page type decides nothing.** Every surface, from a form to a marketing page, gets the same
  register.

Coverage column: *probe* (rendered check), *static* (source check without a browser), *both*,
or *checklist* (review by eye).

## Layout and composition

| Id | Tell | Signal and threshold | Severity | Fix | Coverage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SLOP-001 | The same text-and-image split stamped section after section | ≥ 3 consecutive sections with the same column shape and image side | MEDIUM | Break the run with a stacked or full-width section | checklist |
| SLOP-002 | Identical icon-heading-text tiles as the default way to show anything | ≥ 4 tiles of equal size (±4 px) and structure in one grid, each an icon or image, a heading and text; `ul`, `ol` and `table` grids skipped | MEDIUM | Vary tile size or content shape, or present the items as a list | probe |
| SLOP-003 | Cards inside cards, or bento cells with nothing in them | nesting depth ≥ 3, or cell count ≠ content count | MEDIUM | Remove the extra shell or reshape the grid | checklist |
| SLOP-004 | A split header whose side column only restates the headline | short side column (< 15 words) with no role of its own | MEDIUM | Stack headline and body | checklist |
| SLOP-005 | One section shape reused for unrelated topics | the same structure ≥ 3 times | MEDIUM | Give later repeats a different layout | checklist |
| SLOP-006 | Every gap the same size on a page that needs grouping | ≥ 5 regions and ≥ 10 samples, one 4 px bucket > 85 %, ≤ 3 buckets | MEDIUM | Space by relationship on a real scale | checklist |
| SLOP-007 | Big empty gaps that separate nothing | a gap much larger than its neighbours with no job | LOW | Remove it or give it a grouping role | checklist |

## Decoration

| Id | Tell | Signal and threshold | Severity | Fix | Coverage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SLOP-008 | The reflex violet accent | a gradient stop, or heading text (h1 to h3 or ≥ 20 px), with hue 260° to 310° and an RGB channel spread ≥ 50, unless that hue is the brand's own action colour in ≥ 2 regions | MEDIUM | Neutral surface plus one real brand hue | both |
| SLOP-009 | Gradient-filled headline text | `background-clip: text` with a gradient | MEDIUM | Solid colour; emphasis through weight or size | both |
| SLOP-010 | The same coloured glow repeated | CF-404's glow test (≤ 2 px offset, ≥ 16 px blur, saturation > 0.4) on ≥ 2 unrelated controls or headings, not a focus state; a single glow is CF-404 | MEDIUM | Neutral offset shadow or none | probe |
| SLOP-011 | A faint floating blob with no focal job | an absolutely placed radial gradient under 0.3 opacity that paints only itself (no text, media, control or link inside) | MEDIUM | Remove or tie it to a real focal point | probe (judgment) |
| SLOP-012 | Dot or line grid texture next to other decoration | ≥ 2 gradient layers or a radial dot on a fixed px cell ≤ 48 px, no canvas, table, grid, `role=img` or SVG over 48 px in its section or landmark, beside a SLOP-008 or SLOP-011 signal | MEDIUM | Remove unless it stands in for real data | probe |

| SLOP-015 | Coloured side stripes faking emphasis on cards | on rounded elements: a single-side accent (one side ≥ 2 px saturated, the other three 0 or ≤ 1 px neutral; an all-round outline is not a stripe), an absolutely placed 3 to 12 px `::before`/`::after` bar pinned to one edge (tab and nav indicators skipped), ≥ 2 per scope; an inset 3 to 12 px chromatic shadow counts at 1; status regions and callouts excepted | MEDIUM | Carry emphasis with the fill or an icon | probe |

## Typography

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SLOP-016 | A reflex default face (Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Lato, Montserrat, Arial, Helvetica, Space Grotesk and similar; the Geist family is exempt) | the first family in the stack that actually loaded matches the list (a fallback further down never counts; form controls' browser default is skipped) | MEDIUM | Choose a face for the product or record why the common one stays | both (judgment) |
| SLOP-017 | A display serif with no reason | a shortlisted serif on headings and no recorded rationale | MEDIUM | Sans display, or record the reason | checklist |

| SLOP-058 | Link to nowhere | `href="#"` or `javascript:` (tier derived: a script handler is invisible to the scan) | HIGH for text, nav or call-to-action links; MEDIUM for logo or icon-only links | A real destination, or a real button | both |
| SLOP-059 | A typeless button beside another submit | `<button>` without `type` whose form owner (`button.form`, so `form="id"` counts) has ≥ 2 submit-capable buttons; a lone typeless button is the form's intended submit | HIGH | `type="button"` unless it really submits | probe |

Slides, documents and diagrams share the layout, decoration, typography, colour, copy and
fake-data rows; motion, scroll, hover and carousel rows do not transfer. The office and diagram
skills enforce their own subset in their QA scripts.
