// The one rule table the interface probe measures against. Every id, severity, tier, threshold
// and fix lives here as data; interface-probe-page.mjs reads its numbers from `threshold` and
// interface-probe-static.mjs from the same table, so a threshold change is one edit in this file.
// references/craft-floor.md (CF-*, RS-*) and references/slop-register.md (SLOP-*) describe the same
// ids in prose. Ids and numbers follow the family rule spec of 2026-09-26 (SPEC STATUS: FINAL) with
// its Delta 1 of 2026-09-27.

// `tier` is the default claim tier: `measured` is read straight off the render, `derived` is
// computed from measured values or relies on an approximation the finding names. The probe never
// emits an inferred claim. A rule with `judgment` is DET-assist plus a reviewer's verdict: its hits
// are listed as judgment candidates under "Not verified", never as findings, and its severity
// applies only once a reviewer confirms the hit.
