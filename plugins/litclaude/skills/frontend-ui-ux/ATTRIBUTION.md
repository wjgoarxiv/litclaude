# ATTRIBUTION / NOTICE: frontend-ui-ux craft floor, slop register and interface probe

The craft-floor and slop-register rules (`references/craft-floor.md`,
`references/slop-register.md`), the interface probe (`scripts/interface-probe.mjs` and its
modules) and the build, polish, audit and harden modes were written for LitClaude after studying
three projects. **No source file, prose, fixture or golden file from any of them is vendored,
copied or redistributed here.** A guard test fails if any packed file is byte-identical to one of
their skill files.

The UI/UX Pro Max design data keeps its own notice in `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICE.txt`, which is pinned
to that dataset's provenance; these credits live here so the two records stay independent.
