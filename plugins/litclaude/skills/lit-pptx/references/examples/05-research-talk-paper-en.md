# Staged feeding and conversion in a 20 L reactor
---

---
layout: statement

## Can conversion rise without a larger reactor?

Single-feed runs plateau at 50% conversion after 30 minutes in every pilot vessel we tested.

## Single-feed baseline conversion, 0-60 min

![Figure 1. Conversion over time, single feed, three replicates | Source: example image](assets/example-a.png)

- **Observation** Conversion stalls after 30 minutes: 44% at 30 min, 50% at 60 min
- **Observation** The baseline gains only 6 points after minute 30
- **Basis** 1.0 L/min feed, 20 L reactor, three replicates (example data)
- **Limitation** One temperature and one catalyst batch were tested
- **Implication** The plateau, not the kinetics, limits throughput

## Three-stage feed layout and symbols

- **Layout** the feed is split into three stages along the reactor
- **X** conversion, the fraction of feed that reacted
- **k** first-order rate constant, 1/min
- **τ** residence time per stage, min
- **n** number of feed stages, three in every run
- **q** feed split between stages, 50/30/20 by volume
- **t₂, t₃** start of stages two and three, minute 20 and minute 35

## Conversion over time, staged vs single feed

::: chart type=line unit="%"
| Minute | Single feed (%) | Staged feed (%) |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 10 | 21 | 24 |
| 20 | 36 | 45 |
| 30 | 44 | 59 |
| 40 | 47 | 67 |
| 50 | 49 | 72 |
| 60 | 50 | 75 |
> Mean conversion of three replicates per condition (example data)
:::

- The staged feed leads at every time point after minute 10
- The gap opens after minute 20, when the second stage starts feeding
- At minute 60 the staged feed reaches 75% against 50%
- Replicate spread stays under 3 points in both conditions

## Conversion at 60 min by feed rate

| Feed rate (L/min) | Single feed (%) | Staged feed (%) | Gain (points) | Relative gain (%) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.5 | 52 | 77 | 25 | 48 |
| 0.75 | 51 | 76 | 25 | 49 |
| 1.0 | 50 | 75 | 25 | 50 |
| 1.25 | 49 | 73 | 24 | 49 |
| 1.5 | 47 | 71 | 24 | 51 |
| 2.0 | 41 | 64 | 23 | 56 |

> Table 1. Conversion at 60 minutes by feed rate (example data)

- The gain holds at all six feed rates tested, 23-25 points
- The relative gain is 48-56% at every rate
- The gap narrows by two points at the highest rate
- Heat removal, not the feed schedule, limits the fastest runs

## Pilot-plant operator feedback

## Contributions and limits of this study

:::: columns 1fr 1fr
::: col
- **Contributions**
  (1) Yield: conversion rises from 50% to 75% at equal reactor volume
  (2) Equipment: the schedule needs only valve timing, no new vessel
  (3) Range: the 23-25 point gain holds at six feed rates, 0.5-2.0 L/min
  (4) Evidence: 36 runs, replicates within 3 points of each other
:::
::: col
- **Limits**
  (1) Yield: tested at one temperature (60 °C) and one catalyst batch
  (2) Equipment: pilot scale only, 20 L vessels against 2,000 L in production
  (3) Range: heat removal above 2.0 L/min and at full scale is untested
  (4) Evidence: no cost model yet for the valve control and its upkeep

## Findings and next step

- A three-stage feed lifts conversion from 50% to 75% in the same 60 minutes
- The gain holds from 0.5 to 2.0 L/min feed rate, 23-25 points at every rate
- The schedule needs only valve timing, no new vessel and no new catalyst
- The open question is heat removal: the fastest runs lose two points of gain
- Ask: pilot time for a second temperature (75 °C) and a second catalyst batch, 12 runs
- Next step: a heat-removal model at full scale, Example Process Lab, draft by 15 December 2026
